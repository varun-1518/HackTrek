#### HackTrek: Vulnerable Web Application

---

## **Overview**
HackTrek is a learning platform designed to help security enthusiasts and professionals understand and exploit common web application vulnerabilities. Built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack, HackTrek provides hands-on challenges that simulate real-world security flaws, enabling users to hone their penetration testing skills in a safe environment.

The platform includes challenges like:
- SQL Injection
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- File Upload Vulnerabilities
- Weak Password Validation
- Admin Login Exploitation

HackTrek also includes a **Chatbot** implemented directly within the MERN stack to guide users through challenges.

## **Prerequisites**
Before you can set up HackTrek, ensure you have the following installed:
1. **Node.js** (v14 or later)
2. **MongoDB** (Local or cloud-based)
3. **npm** (Node Package Manager)
4. **Git** (for cloning the repository)

---

## **Code Dependencies**
The platform relies on several dependencies for both backend and frontend functionality. Below are the key dependencies:

### Backend:
- **bcryptjs**: For password hashing.
- **jsonwebtoken**: To create and verify tokens for authentication.
- **xss**: To handle XSS sanitization in vulnerable endpoints.
- **multer**: For managing file uploads in challenges.
- **dotenv**: To manage environment variables.
- **body-parser**: To parse incoming request bodies in a middleware.

### Frontend:
- **axios**: To handle API requests.
- **react-router-dom**: For routing in the frontend.
- **Bootstrap**: For UI components and styling.

To view all dependencies, refer to the `package.json` files in both the `backend` and `frontend` directories.

## **Setup Instructions**

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/varun-1518/HackTrek.git
cd HackTrek
```

### Backend Setup
1. Navigate to the `backend` directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```
2. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory with the following variables:
   ```env
   MONGO_URI=<your_mongo_connection_string>
   PORT=5000
   ```
4. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### Frontend Setup
1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory:
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   ```
2. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the frontend server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## **Features**

### Challenges
1. **SQL Injection**: Exploit database queries to bypass authentication.
2. **XSS (Reflected and DOM-based)**: Inject scripts and manipulate the DOM.
3. **File Upload Vulnerabilities**: Test file upload restrictions and exploit them.
4. **Admin Login**: Gain unauthorized access through improper validation.
5. **Weak Password Validation**: Discover and exploit weak password mechanisms.



### Chatbot Assistant
Implemented within the MERN stack, the chatbot provides:
- Guidance for solving challenges.
- Educational insights and solutions.
